Python Script which when run asks for an input of "e i pi or ratio". After go to chrome music lab song maker with the correct settings (Length:10bars, Beats per bar:7, Split beats into:4, Range: 3 octave)
and using the arrow keys or tool in the top left select the box in the top left corner. Press the s key on the keyboard while the box is selected and the selected pattern will be randomly placed in music lab.
Wait until the code stops running before you do anything else as the script does many keyboard inputs (up,down and right arrows and enter).
